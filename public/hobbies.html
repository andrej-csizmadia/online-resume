    <h1>Andy's hobbies & passions</h1>
    <p>I do not want to present myself only from a professional view, since I am a whole lot more. Personality and hobbies<br>
    shape us also at the work environments and they could help with certain skills and attributes.</p>
        <h2>Sports & physical activity</h2>
            <p></p>I enjoy several sports and physical activities as I believe they not only help the physical health, however also mental.<br>
        Among them you could definitely find: 
            <ul>
                <li>Strength training</li>
                <li>Running outside (especially during colder months)</li>
                <li>Swimming</li>
                <li>Rollerskating</li>
                <li>Taking long walks with my dog</li>
            </ul>

<br>
        <h2>Mental activities</h2>
            <p>Shaping and keeping our mental health in a good condition is as important as keeping us fit from the outside. Hence,<br>
            I like to do in my freetime:</p>
            <ul>
                <li>Reading books (scifi, non-fiction, books about universe and societies)</li>
                <li>Practicing languages & improving them</li>
                <li>Learning new digital skills</li>
                <li>Playing video games on PS5 & PC</li>
            </ul>

            <img src="../assets/three-body-problem-series.jpg" width="320"/>
            <p>One of the best book series I have ever read. Highly recommend this hard scifi to every enthusiast.</p>
<br>
        <h2>Creativity</h2>
            <p>I consider myself as a creative person, who like to craft both physical and virtual objects. To name few, which I like<br>
            the most:</p>
            <ul>
                <li>Cooking, baking & trying new recipes</li>
                <li>Painting, visiting workshops</li>
                <li>Recording & editing videos</li>
                <li>Coding & building websites</li>
            </ul>

            <img src="../assets/three-body-problem-series.jpg" width="320"/>
            <p>Creativity reached new heights with the blend of my cooking, baking and video-editing skills.</p>
